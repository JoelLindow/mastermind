      Mastermind is a game where you must try to guess the secret combination.
      The combination will be randomly generated by the computer. Your goal
      will be to guess this secret combination in as few guesses as possible.

    You will be using 4 different colored pegs. The randomly generated combination
    will also be made up of the same pegs:(R)ed, (G)reen, (B)lue and (Y)ellow.
    For example the computer might generate a secret code of 'RRRR' which you will
    not be able to see. You start by guessing a 4 peg combination such as 'RRBG'.
    The program will compare your guess with the randomly generated combo and let
    you know how close your guess was. You may use the clues provided to continue
    guessing until you have guessed the correct combination.

         Crack the code! Feel the rush! Save the world! This is Mastermind!
